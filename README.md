# Pay-calculator
Hey everyone. This is my first project that I have uploaded to github using Python. For this calculator, 40 hours is considered a regular pay period.
Anything over that is considered as overtime and your regular pay rate is multiplied by 1.5. I am from a non-CS background and am teaching myself to code using MOOCs.
So, I would really appreciate if you use this and leave any positive or negative feedback as necessary. Thank you.
